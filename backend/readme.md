## Usage Limits and Fair Use Policy

We believe in providing open and accessible APIs to everyone. However, to ensure fair use of our API and protect our servers from abuse, we have implemented usage limits. These limits are designed to prevent any single user from monopolizing our resources and negatively impacting other users.

The following usage limits apply to our API:

- Unauthorized/Without Any Authorization (15 req/hr)
- Level 1 Authentication (150 req/hr)
- Level 2 Authentication (10k+ req/hr)

If you anticipate needing more API calls than the limits allow, please contact us to discuss options for increasing your usage. We are always happy to work with our users to provide the resources they need while ensuring the best possible experience for everyone.
